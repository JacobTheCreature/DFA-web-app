### If you want to run this yourself follow these steps:

(Ensure you also have npm installed, if `ng serve` does not work run `npm install -g @angular/cli` then try again)

1. Clone the repo

2. cd into the frontend folder

3. run `npm i`

4. run `ng serve`

5. go to localhost:4200

### For grading the logic look at these files:

frontend > src > app > components > transition-table > transition-table.component.ts

This is where the main logic for constructing and checking DFAs

frontend > src > app > services > dfa.service.ts

This is where the logic is to check if a given DFA is valid

### AI Acknowledgement

So I made to so simplify with bootstrap and provided the basic HTML format first.
